## Demo  

## Inspiration  
Readsify started from a problem I‚Äôve faced as a reader‚Äîspending more time searching for the perfect book than actually reading. It‚Äôs frustrating when the hunt for something enjoyable takes so much energy that it drains the excitement. That's why I developed Readsify, a web app that helps ease these common reader problems.
