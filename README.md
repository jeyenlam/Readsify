## Inspiration  
Readsify started from a problem I’ve faced as a reader—spending more time searching for the perfect book than actually reading. It’s frustrating when the hunt for something enjoyable takes so much energy that it drains the excitement. That’s how Readsify was developed, it's a web app that helps ease these common reader problems and was built with a motto of "more reading, less searching".

## Development Highlights
- Data Engineering: My first time with a more realistic data engineering experience. I've learned about a decent process of data engineering from looking at datasets and eye-balled evaluate them, pick the best-fit among dozen even hundred datasets, then the process of tool evaulate that dataset and clean it.
